Generally speaking, when we refine the mesh, we get finer structures and more details. However, I don't see different structures coming out with the refinement of the mesh. The structures are rather a serie of continious evolution. 
When we give a larger gamma, more material is allowed to be used. We can see that the structures are becoming vague. The penalisation seems to need some reenforcing to handle the case with more material. 
It is worth mentionning that while resolving the second exercise, the algorithme can stuck at some point with a huge objective function (magnitude of 1e+9) and step decreasing ceaselessly. A possible solution is to adjust the initial step. Experiments show that 0.1 works for the case with n=10 (but 0.05 doesn't work), 0.05 works for n=20. For n=30, we can't find a proper step (neither 0.1, 0.05, nor 0.01 works).
